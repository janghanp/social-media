How are you going to manage images that were already uploaded and new images?
  - How to compare previous files and new files?

1. Replace whole images and delete previous images on the bucket.

2. Leave images that has no change and update the rest of them.
  - Is it possible to chagne the actual object with same key in the bucekt?? (same key name - different file.)
   - By default, if you upload a file with same name, it will override the existing file. If you want to keep the previous one, enable versioning option in the bucket.




**  use GetObjectCommand to check if an image is already in posts/ directory with the Key value that is going to be passed from client side.
  -> yes it exists -> Do not copy an object from temp.
  -> no it doesn't -> Copy an object from temp.

** Or get the post's files data and compare with new Keys from  client side.
